Encode permissions
==================

Create, grant, and revoke many permissions in just one vote.

## Usage
1. Change `permissions.json` data. Set up the DAO, voting and ACL apps, and the
list of permissions you want to add or revoke in the form of
`[entity, onApp, role]`.
2. Execute `node index.js` to run the command.
3. On successful, open your DAO and see the new vote.
